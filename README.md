[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/ravenrd/DRAMPower/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/ravenrd/DRAMPower?branch=master)
## 0. Releases

The last official release can be found here:
https://github.com/ravenrd/DRAMPower/releases/tag/4.0

The master branch of the repository should be regarded as the bleeding-edge version, which has all the latest features, but also all the latest bugs. Use at your own discretion.

## 1. Installation

Clone the repository, or download the zip file of the release you would like to use. The source code is available in src folder. [drampower.cc](src/cli/drampower.cc) file gives the user interface, where the user can specify the memory to be employed and the commandtrace to be analyzed. To build, use:
```bash
make -j4
```
This command will download a set of trace files from https://github.com/Sv3n/DRAMPowerTraces which can be used as test input for the tool.

## 2. Required Packages

The tool was verified on Ubuntu 14.04 using:

 * xerces-c (libxerces-c-dev) - v3.1 with Xerces development package
 * gcc - v4.4.3

## 3. Directory Structure
 * src/: contains the source code of the DRAMPower tool that covers the power  model, the command scheduler and the trace analysis tool.
 * memspecs/   : contains the memory specification XMLs, which give the architectural, timing and current/voltage details for different DRAM memories.
 * traces/     : 1 sample command trace (after the installation / compilation)
 * test/       : contains test script and reference output

## 4. Command Trace Specification
If the command-level interface is being used, a command trace can be logged in a file.
An example is given in ```traces/commands.trace```

The format it uses is: ```<timestamp>,<command>,<bank>```.
For example, "500,ACT,2", where ACT is the command and 2 is the bank. Timestamp is in clock cycles (cc), the list of supported commands is
mentioned in [MemCommand.h](src/MemCommand.h) and the bank is the target bank number. For non-bank-specific commands, bank can be set to 0. Rank need not be
specified. The timing correctness of the trace is not verified by the tool and is assumed to be accurate. However, warning messages are provided, to identify if the memory or bank state is inconsistent in the trace. A sample command trace is provided in the traces/ folder.

## 5. Usage

[drampower.cc](src/cli/drampower.cc) is the main interface file, which accepts user inputs to specify memory to be employed and the command trace to be analyzed.

To use DRAMPower at the command-level (command trace), after make, use the following:
```bash
./drampower -m <memory spec (ID)> -c <commands trace>
```
Also,the user can optionally include IO and Termination power estimates (obtained from 
Micron's DRAM Power Calculator). To enable the same, the '-r' flag can be employed in 
command line.

## 6. Memory Specifications

36 sample memory specifications are given in the XMLs targeting DDR2/DDR3/DDR4, LPDDR/LPDDR2/LPDDR3 and WIDE IO DRAM devices. The memory specifications are based on 1Gb DDR2, 1Gb & 2Gb DDR3, 2Gb LPDDR/LPDDR2 and 4Gb DDR4/LPDDR3 Micron datasheets and the 256Mb Wide IO SDR specifications are based on JEDEC timing specifications and circuit-level IDD measurements by TU Kaiserslautern, inplace of the as yet unavailable vendor datasheets. 4 of the memory specifications target dual-rank DDR3 DIMMs.

Note: The timing specifications in the XMLs are in clock cycles (cc). The current specifications for Reading and Writing do not include the I/O consumption. They are computed and included seperately based on Micron Power Calculator. The IDD measures associated with different power supply sources of equal measure (VDD2, VDDCA and VDDQ) for LPDDR2, LPDDR3, DDR4 and WIDE IO memories have been added up together for simplicity, since it does not impact power computation accuracy. The current measures for dual-rank DIMMs reflect only the measures for the active rank. The default state of the idle rank is assumed to be the same as the complete memory state, for background power estimation. Accordingly, in all dual-rank memory specifications, IDD2P0 has been subtracted from the active currents and all background currents have been halved. They are also accounted for seperately by the power model. Stacking multiple Wide IO DRAM dies can also be captured by the nbrOfRanks parameter.

## 7. Variation-aware Power And Energy Estimation

15 of the included datasheets reflect the impact of process-variations on DRAM currents for a selection of DDR3 memories manufactured at 50nm process technology. These memories include:
(1) MICRON_128MB_DDR3-1066_8bit - revision G
(2) MICRON_128MB_DDR3-1066_16bit - revision G
(3) MICRON_128MB_DDR3-1600_8bit - revision G
(4) MICRON_256MB_DDR3-1066_8bit - revision D
(5) MICRON_256MB_DDR3-1600_16bit - revision D

The original vendor-provided datasheet current specifications are given in XMLs
without suffixes such as _mu, _2s and _3s. XMLs including suffixes indicate that the
current measures are either: (1) typical (mu), or (2) include +2 sigma variation (2s),
or (3) include +3 sigma variation (3s). These measures are derived based on the
Monte-Carlo analysis performed on our SPICE-based DRAM cross-section.

To include these XMLs in your simulations, simply use them as the target memory.

## 8. Example Usage

An example of using this tool is provided below. To compile the example,
use the Makefile and make sure the gcc and Xerces-c are installed. Then, run:
```
make -j4
```
After this, run with the command trace, as described before:
```
./drampower -m memspecs/MICRON_1Gb_DDR3-1066_8bit_G.xml -t traces/commands.trace -r
```
The output should be something like this:

```

As can be noticed, the tool performs DRAM command scheduling and reports the number
of activates, precharges, reads, writes, refreshes, power-downs and self-refreshes
besides the number of clock cycles spent in the active and precharged states, in the
power-down (fast/slow-exit) and self-refresh states and in the idle mode. It also
reports the energy consumption of these components, besides the IO and Termination
components in pJ (pico Joules) and the average power consumption of the trace in mW.
It also reports the simulation start/end times and the total simulation time in seconds.

## 9. DRAMPower Library

The DRAMPower tool has an additional feature and can be used as a library.
In order to use the library run "make lib", include [LibDRAMPower.h](src/libdrampower/LibDRAMPower.h) in your project and
link the file src/libdrampower.a with your project.
Examples for the usage of the library are [lib_test.cc](test/libdrampowertest/lib_test.cc) and [window_example.cc](test/libdrampowertest/window_example.cc).

## 10. Authors & Acknowledgment

The tool is based on the DRAM power model developed jointly by the Computer Engineering Research Group at TU Delft and the Electronic Systems Group at TU Eindhoven
