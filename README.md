[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ravenrd/DRAMPower.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ravenrd/DRAMPower)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/ravenrd/DRAMPower/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/ravenrd/DRAMPower?branch=master)
## 0. Releases

The last official release can be found here:
https://github.com/ravenrd/DRAMPower/releases/tag/4.0

The master branch of the repository should be regarded as the bleeding-edge version, which has all the latest features, but also all the latest bugs. Use at your own discretion.

## 1. Installation

Clone the repository, or download the zip file of the release you would like to use. The source code is available in src folder. src/cli/drampower.cc file gives the user interface, where the user can specify the memory to be employed and the command/transaction trace to be analyzed. To build, use:
```bash
make -j4
```
This command will download a set of trace files from https://github.com/Sv3n/DRAMPowerTraces which can be used as test input for the tool.

## 2. Required Packages

The tool was verified on Ubuntu 14.04 using:

 * xerces-c (libxerces-c-dev) - v3.1 with Xerces development package. If your Xerces package is not installed in /usr directory, Please specifiy the Xerces root directory when run the make command. For example __make XERCES_ROOT=/opt/local__.
 * gcc - v4.4.3

## 3. Directory Structure
 * src/: contains the source code of the DRAMPower tool that covers the power  model, the command scheduler and the trace analysis tool.
 * memspecs/   : contains the memory specification XMLs, which give the architectural, timing and current/voltage details for different DRAM memories.
 * traces/     : contains 4 sample DRAM transaction traces and 1 sample command trace (after the installation / compilation)
 * test/       : contains test script and reference output

## 4. Trace Specification
### Command Traces
If the command-level interface is being used, a command trace can be logged in a file.
An example is given in ```traces/commands.trace```

The format it uses is: ```<timestamp>,<command>,<bank>```.
For example, "500,ACT,2", where ACT is the command and 2 is the bank. Timestamp is in clock cycles (cc), the list of supported commands is
mentioned in src/MemCommand.h and the bank is the target bank number. For non-bank-specific commands, bank can be set to 0. Rank need not be
specified. The timing correctness of the trace is not verified by the tool and is assumed to be accurate. However, warning messages are provided, to identify if the memory or bank state is inconsistent in the trace. A sample command trace is provided in the traces/ folder.

### Transaction Traces
If the transaction-level interface is being used, a transaction trace can be logged.

The format it uses is: ```<timestamp>,<transaction_type>,<address>```.
For example, "35,READ,0x80028", where READ/WRITE can be the transaction type and the logical address (32-bits long and byte addressable) less than the maximum supported DRAM capacity of 4GB (32Gb).

The tool uses a flexible and efficient memory map as follows: specified in HEX (0x). Timestamp is in clock cycles (cc) and maximum {row}-{bank}-{column}-{BI}-{BC}-{BGI}-{BL}
Here, BI gives the degree of bank interleaving, BC gives the burst size (count), BGI gives the degree of bank group interleaving (for DDR4) and BL gives the burst length used by the device.
Dual-Rank addressing is not yet supported. The BC and BL address bits are derived from the column address bits, whereas the BI and BGI bits are derived from the bank address bits.

Four sample MediaBench application transaction traces have been provided. The MediaBench applications include: (1) EPIC Encoder, (2) JPEG Encoder, (3) H263 Encoder and (4) MPEG2 Encoder. These applications were independently executed on the SimpleScalar simulator with a 16KB L1 D-cache, 16KB L1 I-cache, 128KB L2 cache and 64-byte cache line configuration. We filtered out the L2 cache misses meant for the DRAM and logged them as transaction traces. These can be used with our command scheduler to generate equivalent command traces for any DRAM memory specified.

## 5. Usage

src/cli/drampower.cc is the main interface file, which accepts user inputs to specify memory to be employed and the command or transaction trace to be analyzed. If the transaction trace (DRAM command scheduler) is being used, the users can specify the degree of bank interleaving required, the request size and the use of power-down or self-refresh options. Also, for DDR4 memories bank group interleaving can be specified. Dual-rank DRAMs are not yet supported by the command scheduler. Note: Speculative use of power-down or self-refresh modes will increase the trace length due to the power-up latencies of these power-saving modes.

To use DRAMPower at the command-level (command trace), after make, use the following:
```bash
./drampower -m <memory spec (ID)> -c <commands trace>
```
To use DRAMPower at the transaction-level (command scheduler), after make, use the
following:
```bash
./drampower -m <memory spec (ID)> -t <transactions trace>
```
Additional options when using transactions trace [-t] include:
 * [-i] ```<interleaving>```
 * [-s] ```<request size>```
 * [-g] ```<DDR4 bank group interleaving>```
 * [-p] ```<0 - No Power-Down, 1 - Power-Down, 2 - Self-Refresh>```

Also, when using either the commands trace or the transactions trace, the user can
optionally include IO and Termination power estimates (obtained from Micron's DRAM
Power Calculator). To enable the same, the '-r' flag can be employed in command line.

If these options are not used, the default values assumed are:
* interleaving = 1
* request size = burst length * I/O width / 8 (in bytes) (from memory XMLs)
* power saving = No power-down
* bank group interleaving = 1
* IO and termination = OFF (0)
* Burst size (count) of 1

## 6. Memory Specifications

36 sample memory specifications are given in the XMLs targeting DDR2/DDR3/DDR4, LPDDR/LPDDR2/LPDDR3 and WIDE IO DRAM devices. The memory specifications are based on 1Gb DDR2, 1Gb & 2Gb DDR3, 2Gb LPDDR/LPDDR2 and 4Gb DDR4/LPDDR3 Micron datasheets and the 256Mb Wide IO SDR specifications are based on JEDEC timing specifications and circuit-level IDD measurements by TU Kaiserslautern, inplace of the as yet unavailable vendor datasheets. 4 of the memory specifications target dual-rank DDR3 DIMMs.

Note: The timing specifications in the XMLs are in clock cycles (cc). The current specifications for Reading and Writing do not include the I/O consumption. They are computed and included seperately based on Micron Power Calculator. The IDD measures associated with different power supply sources of equal measure (VDD2, VDDCA and VDDQ) for LPDDR2, LPDDR3, DDR4 and WIDE IO memories have been added up together for simplicity, since it does not impact power computation accuracy. The current measures for dual-rank DIMMs reflect only the measures for the active rank. The default state of the idle rank is assumed to be the same as the complete memory state, for background power estimation. Accordingly, in all dual-rank memory specifications, IDD2P0 has been subtracted from the active currents and all background currents have been halved. They are also accounted for seperately by the power model. Stacking multiple Wide IO DRAM dies can also be captured by the nbrOfRanks parameter.

## 7. Variation-aware Power And Energy Estimation

15 of the included datasheets reflect the impact of process-variations on DRAM currents for a selection of DDR3 memories manufactured at 50nm process technology. These memories include:
(1) MICRON_128MB_DDR3-1066_8bit - revision G
(2) MICRON_128MB_DDR3-1066_16bit - revision G
(3) MICRON_128MB_DDR3-1600_8bit - revision G
(4) MICRON_256MB_DDR3-1066_8bit - revision D
(5) MICRON_256MB_DDR3-1600_16bit - revision D

The original vendor-provided datasheet current specifications are given in XMLs
without suffixes such as _mu, _2s and _3s. XMLs including suffixes indicate that the
current measures are either: (1) typical (mu), or (2) include +2 sigma variation (2s),
or (3) include +3 sigma variation (3s). These measures are derived based on the
Monte-Carlo analysis performed on our SPICE-based DRAM cross-section.

To include these XMLs in your simulations, simply use them as the target memory.

## 8. Example Usage

As can be noticed, the tool performs DRAM command scheduling and reports the number
of activates, precharges, reads, writes, refreshes, power-downs and self-refreshes
besides the number of clock cycles spent in the active and precharged states, in the
power-down (fast/slow-exit) and self-refresh states and in the idle mode. It also
reports the energy consumption of these components, besides the IO and Termination
components in pJ (pico Joules) and the average power consumption of the trace in mW.
It also reports the simulation start/end times and the total simulation time in seconds.

## 9. DRAMPower Library

The DRAMPower tool has an additional feature and can be used as a library.
In order to use the library run "make lib", include src/libdrampower/LibDRAMPower.h in your project and
link the file src/libdrampower.a with your project.
An example for the usuage of the library can be found in the folder test/libdrampowertest/lib_test.cc

## 10. Authors & Acknowledgment
